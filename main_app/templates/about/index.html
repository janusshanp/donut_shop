				<span>Our Entrance into the Donut World</span>
				Since dough (day) 1 we’ve been passionate about donuts. Dough is more than
				about creating donuts, it’s about reinventing the dessert scene and creating
				an experience for our customers. We want each donut to tell their dough
				story.

				<p>Authentically Torontonian</p>
				<p>Born and raised in Toronto, dough founders were inspired by the culinary scene in the diverse city. They dedicated their craft to showcase what it means to be a baker in Toronto and vowed to put themselves on the map, and in their customers stomach.</p>

				<p>Top Quality Ingredients</p>
				<p>Our bakers value top ingredients, and searched high and low to find Canadian local ingrediants to support the market and to create beautiful flavour profiles. They value the four seasons in the country, and always researching to find what is in season and how they can translate farm to table desserts. </p>
